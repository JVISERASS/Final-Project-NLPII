It is a game of real skill and strategy, requiring physical fitness, agility, strength and stamina as well as mental rigour, concentration, resilience and also stamina. \n\nIn the longest form of the game, it is indeed a possible outcome that two teams can play each other for five days and a DRAW is still possible.
